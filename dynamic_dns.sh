# Description: This is a simple script that does the following:
#              1. Gets the external IP from the router
#              2. Compares it with the IP that is mapped to the domain
#              3. If the IPs differ, then
#                   a. There has been a change of your IP
#                   b. The DNS server is updated with the new IP
#              4. If the IPs do not differ, then no action is taken
#
# Requirements (on debian): curl, grep, jq, dnsutils
#

	# I'm using a combination of bind and webhook (both debian packages) on a remote server, something like
	# curl -s "http://mydomain.com:9000/webhook/IPchange?token=**************" -d "IP=$ROUTERIP" -d "domain=$DOMAIN"

	# Use telegram (or any other tool) to notify you about the IP change
